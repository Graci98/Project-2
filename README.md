# Project-2

This research employed a binary variable, "DEFAULT" (Yes = 1, No = 0), as the target variable, which designates whether or not the individual defaulted the following month. This study used the following 23 variables as explanatory variables:

LIMIT_BAL: Amount of the given credit (New Taiwan dollar): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her family (supplementary) credit.

SEX: (1 = male; 2 = female).

EDUCATION: (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others).

MARRIAGE: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others).

AGE: (year).

PAY_1 - PAY_6: History of past payment. The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -2 = no consumption; -1 = pay duly; 0 = the use of revolving credit; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above. We tracked the past monthly payment records (from April to September, 2005) as follows:
    PAY_1 = the repayment status in September, 2005;
    PAY_2 = the repayment status in August, 2005;
    PAY_3 = the repayment status in July, 2005;
    PAY_4 = the repayment status in June, 2005;
    PAY_5 = the repayment status in May, 2005;
    PAY_6 = the repayment status in April, 2005.
    
BILL_AMT1 - BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement (New Taiwan dollar).
    BILL_AMT1 = amount of bill statement in September, 2005;
    BILL_AMT2 = amount of bill statement in August, 2005;
    BILL_AMT3 = amount of bill statement in July, 2005;
    BILL_AMT4 = amount of bill statement in June, 2005;
    BILL_AMT5 = amount of bill statement in May, 2005;
    BILL_AMT6 = amount of bill statement in April, 2005.
    
PAY_AMT1 - PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment (New Taiwan dollar).
    PAY_AMT1 = amount paid in September, 2005;
    PAY_AMT2 = amount paid in August, 2005;
    PAY_AMT3 = amount paid in July, 2005;
    PAY_AMT4 = amount paid in June, 2005;
    PAY_AMT5 = amount paid in May, 2005;
    PAY_AMT6 = amount paid in April, 2005.
